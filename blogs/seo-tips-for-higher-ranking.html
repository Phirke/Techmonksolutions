                        <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of using marketing insights to improve the quality of content on your website.</p> 
                        <p>This helps your business get more traffic, increase conversions, and organically rank higher on search engine result pages</p>
                        <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of using marketing insights to improve the quality of content on your website. This helps your business get more traffic, increase conversions, and organically rank higher on search engine result pages. </p>
                        <p>The majority of online searches begin with a search engine like Google. In fact, 75 percent of those searches start on Google.</p>
                        <p>The ultimate goal of this article is to help you understand the ins and outs of search so you can optimize your content to rank higher on Google and get more eyeballs on your posts.</p>
                        <p>SEO ranking factors have changed a lot over the years. To understand SEO better, let’s break down the factors that are essential for ranking your site on top:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Appropriate Keywords:<br>
                                The most important SEO strategy is the placement of keywords throughout your page. When making decisions about what products or services you offer, you should assume that someone will search for information about them using the keywords for which they would use. But where you use your keywords is just as important as how many times you use them. Specifically, you want to make sure that your keyword appears at least once in your page’s title tag. 
                            </li><br>
                            <li>Understanding Sitemaps:<br>
                            An effective sitemap is a list of links to all the major web pages on your website to allow search spiders to locate pages more quickly. Each page of your website is thus easier to find and can be easily accessed with fewer clicks.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>Optimize URL Structure:<br>
                            It’s crucial to make the URLs easy for search engines to find, read and understand. Keep the URL short, relevant to the page’s topic and keywords. Search engines consider the keywords in your site's URL just as much as they consider the keywords on a page.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>Alt Text:<br>
                            Alt tag text must be maintained properly. This is because search engines can’t read images. Having proper alt tag text will enable better crawling for search engines and as a result will improve your website’s SEO.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>Codes:<br>
                            Having flawless, neat, and tidy codes will add a plus point to your site SEO. Search engines find it easier to crawl through well-structured websites and as a result, they prefer these sites when assigning rank.</li><br>
                            <li>Website Page Speed:<br>
                            According to Google, sites that load under five seconds have 70% longer sessions. In other words, if your website takes longer to load, then no matter how great your content is, visitors will lose interest and close the page. Your page loading time is important for a few reasons.<br>
                            First of all, if your load speed is too slow, Google will recognize this, and it will harm your ranking.
                            But a slow website will also impact the way your website visitors engage with your pages. As a result, those negative interactions will hurt your   ranking too.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>Publish new and high quality content frequently:<br>
                            Content that is regularly updated is considered to be a good indicator of relevance. Keep it fresh at all times. To drive more traffic to your website and increase its popularity, you need to give visitors a reason to keep coming back. Your content needs to be high quality, recent, and relevant. If your site has fresh, exciting, or newsworthy information, it will keep visitors on your page longer and improve your dwell time. Websites that provide highly informative content typically have long dwell times.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>Image Optimization:<br>
                            Optimize your post or page image so that it can render easily when page loads. The keywords in the “image title” and the “alt text” help to make your blog post or page more focused and targeted. Pictures and other images are great for your website. But you need to make sure they are optimized properly if you want these images to improve your SEO ranking. Pictures and other images are great for your website. You can also use your images to sneak in keywords by naming them accordingly. 
                            </li><br>
                            <li>Add More Than Text:<br>
                            The content on your website shouldn’t be only written words. As I said earlier, pictures are great too, but there’s more you can add to improve your SEO ranking. Consider adding other multimedia elements such as videos, slideshows, or audio to your site. All of this can help improve the user experience. It’s much easier to watch something than read about it.
                            <br>
                            But there’s a direct correlation between videos and other multimedia sources on your website, and it’s SEO ranking. These features can dramatically improve the amount of time someone spends on your website. Depending on the length of your videos, people could be on your page for several minutes. If that happens, it will definitely boost your search ranking.
                            </li><br>
                            <li>Voice Search Optimization:<br>
                            Over the years, the way users search for information online has transformed significantly. 
                            In that case, if you are planning to optimize for voice search, follow the below steps:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Consider choosing wise keywords</li>
                                <li>Always remember to create persona-based content.</li>
                                <li>Create web pages that answer FAQs because when searchers ask a question, they begin their question with words like "When", "What", and "Who"</li> 
                            </ul>
                            According to Forbes, voice search drastically improves user experience. As we use it extensively, search engines such as Google are focusing on voice search optimization.<br>
                            Google voice search shows websites on top that load quickly. In that case, you must always ensure that:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Your website has a responsive design</li>
                                <li>Website images are optimized</li>
                                <li>Always choose long-tail keywords</li>
                                <li>Site loads in a minimum amount of time</li>
                                <li>Your server's response time is low</li> 
                            </ul>
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Maximize User Engagement<br>
                        From updating existing posts to creating new ones, pages should be built to maximize engagement. Here are some great ways you can maximize user engagement on your posts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Be easy to read:<br>
                            Content utilizes whitespace, headings, short paragraphs, and relevant images to make the page easier to absorb and increasing the user’s time on the page.</li>
                            <li>Include highly relevant links and offers on the page<br>
                            Offering relevant internal links that will answer a reader’s question. This often can significantly decrease bounce rates, and get users further into your site.
                            </li>
                            <li>Contain multiple ways for users to absorb the content:<br> 
                            Include images, infographics, video, and text. This will capture readers’ attention, and keep them more engaged in the content.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Employing these tactics will ensure that your pages are highly valuable to the readers, and search engines will mark these pages as high-quality content.    
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Focus on Mobile-First Indexing:<br>
                            Mobile-First indexing just means that Google now considers the mobile version of your site to be the primary version of your site. If you don’t have a mobile site, your desktop site will still be used. But, if your site isn’t mobile-friendly your rankings may take a hit; remember that user experience is huge. 
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Link to Other Websites with Relevant Content:<br>
                            Some people think, linking out to relevant and authoritative content pages is bad because it takes people off your page. But that's not the case. Link building remains a fundamental part of smart search engine optimization strategy. Link building is also all about quality, not quantity. You’ll build more trust in your niche if you have a few authoritative links rather than a dozen poor quality links.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>Build Momentum with Social Signals:<br>
                            Social media is an integral part of SEO strategy and social signals are important. You’ve got to focus on increasing yours. It’s true that Google hasn’t added social signals into their ranking algorithm factors, but social signals do impact search engine rankings. Well, several case studies have proven the impact of social shares, likes, tweets, and pins on search engine rankings.
                        </li>

                    <p>Bonus SEO Tip: Don’t Change Your Domain Name Regularly.</p>

                    <p>If you’ve published a post in the past that’s no longer relevant to users, especially due to the recent Google changes, work to update that page. Or worst-case scenario, 301 redirect it to a newer, fresher piece of content on your site.</p>
                    <p>That way, you can retain the backlinks, social media shares, and other on-site engagement metrics it’s already earned.</p>
                    <p>Finally, learn to focus on and create content around long-tail search phrases (e.g., social media marketing techniques), and not head keywords (e.g., social media).</p>
                    <p>When link building, think quality, not quantity. And, don’t forget to make your web pages mobile-friendly.</p>
