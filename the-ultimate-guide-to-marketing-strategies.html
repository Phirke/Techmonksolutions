            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Developing a business is not an easy task. First, you need a viable idea. From there, you need to find a
              profitable niche, define a target population, and sell something valuable to them. Whether you are selling
              products, services, or information, it becomes more and more troublesome to tell the information.</p>
            <p>Once you have established your business idea and market, you need to find the right Marketing strategy to
              attract potential customers and convert them. Without the right marketing strategy to drive your growth,
              it is almost impossible to create profits and staying afloat.
            <p>A powerful Marketing strategy should encompass your business values, value proposition, and critical
              demographics, among other crucial elements. It should also take advantage of both offline and online
              strategies.</p>
            <p>Marketing and sales go hand in hand. The amount of energy you spend on your marketing strategy will
              determine the success of your business. The basics of marketing are to reach and engage with the target
              market to increase sales. </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Product mock-ups:<br>
                The best way to showcase your product to potential customers is through example. So, creating mock-ups
                will not only explain what your product is, it will also feature how it can be used in real life
                situations.<br>
                Mock-ups can be used in traditional and digital advertising such as billboards, magazines, banner ads,
                email marketing, and more. Ideally, you don’t want to design these yourself. Always use a professional
                marketing designer who is experienced in what you need and your brand vision.
              </li><br>
              <li>Partner with a marketing agency:<br>
                Managing a comprehensive marketing plan within a small startup is hectic. In this case, outsourcing your
                marketing is a wise choice. With a third party, you get to enjoy the full expertise of marketing
                professionals at a lower cost. 63% of B2B marketers use marketing agencies to accomplish their marketing
                goals. Professionals will also give you an ideal marketing strategy example and let you envision your
                future.
              </li><br>
              <li>B2B Marketing:<br>
                B2B (business-to-business) marketing refers to any marketing strategy or content that is geared towards
                a business or organization. Companies that sell products or services to other businesses or
                organizations use B2B marketing strategies.
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>An e-commerce company that sells office supplies to remote or self-employed individuals.</li>
                </ul><br>
                In B2C, customers are mainly interested in the benefits a product or service offers. Most B2C buyers
                purchase based emotions rather than logic.
              </li><br>
              <li>Continue evolving your brand values(Rebrand):<br>
                The current world situation has changed how businesses do marketing. Empathy and design thinking are
                playing significant roles in the advertising and marketing industries. Thus, your brand identity and
                messaging will need constant change and upgrades. Emotional connection with a brand is now more crucial
                than ever.A logo redesign or a new color combination may be the upgrade your brand needs.
              </li><br>
              <li>Get a mix of new and old ways to market:<br>
                Embracing digital transformation is the way to go. However, there are excellent opportunities when you
                blend your new strategies with the old ones.<br>
                As much as some people believe that traditional advertising is going down, statistics show otherwise.
                Along with your digital marketing efforts, consider the following traditional methods:
                <ol>
                  <li>Billboards</li>
                  <li>Television ads</li>
                  <li>Print ads</li>
                  <li>Print ads</li>
                  <li>Banner ads</li>
                </ol>

              </li><br>
              <li> Business Cards:<br>
                Investing in well-made business cards is one of the most effective ways to get your business out there.
                Set your brand apart by choosing a unique design that reflects your brand values and creativity.<br>
                Always ensure that everyone who is anyone in your company has their own to give away because you never
                know when they’ll need to share your business details with a prospective client.
              </li><br>
              <li>Create pamphlets and flyers:<br>
                Another way to get your brand message out to your target market is to give away printed marketing
                material. Flyer printing may seem like an old tactic, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t get results,
                especially if you’re heading to a trade show, or trying to gain some visibility in your local area. Go
                the extra mile and innovate beyond the standard template.
              </li><br>
              <li>Publish a book:<br>
                OYour business is likely passionate about the knowledge it provides and is probably already sharing
                valuable information with its customers. Try turning your blog and helpful information into a brief
                pamphlet or book. You can even promote it as an ebook.
              </li><br>
              <li>Offer coupons:<br>
                There’s no better way to foster brand loyalty and get your message out there than by throwing a sale. By
                offering coupons, loyalty programs, special discounts, and more you’re making clients feel privileged
                while boosting leads and sales. Advertise the incentives and you’ll even get the attention of
                prospective clients.
              </li><br>
              <li>Network your way to success:<br>
                Even with a small business, you can network your way to success. There are countless opportunities to
                build a business network even in a small town, so make sure that you attend all relevant business
                activities in your area.<br>
                If your area doesn’t have a business group, round up some interested business owners and meet up to
                start a small network.
              </li><br>
              <li>Sales Productivity Tools:<br>
                Marketing goes hand-in-hand with sales productivity tools to reduce downtime and increase efficiency.
                Different tools serve various purposes from enabling video calls, conferencing, and webinars, lead
                generation, email outreach, and CRM. An example of a sales engagement platform (SEP) is Salesforce which
                is crucial for email tracking and CRM. The purpose of SEPs is to help your sales team deliver
                high-quality interactions and consequently, market your band.
              </li><br>
              <li>Event Marketing:<br>
                B2B event marketing takes advantage of offline marketing. It helps you interact directly with potential
                leads and clients. With the average CMO allocating 24% of their budget on event marketing, you should
                also consider this strategy for your business.<br>
                There are several ways to take advantage of event marketing. The first is signing up for exhibits to
                generate leads. The second is VIP dinners to mingle with C-level executives, and conferences to boost
                brand awareness and establish your presence in the industry.
              </li><br>
              <li> Advertisement:<br>
                Perhaps the most obvious type of offline marketing is to pay for adverts. Just like you would with an
                online advert, you’ll have to choose a platform to display your advert, think of an offer, and create
                the advert.<br>
                There are plenty of places you could choose to place adverts including magazines, newspapers, TV, radio,
                and billboards. While you may never be able to target your adverts at quite the granular level you can
                online, you can still get pretty specific with who will see your advert. The good thing about this is it
                means almost any business can afford to run print ads.
              </li><br>
              <li>Sponsorship:<br>
                Like advertising, sponsorships are a good way for a brand to get their product in front of a specific
                audience. However, sponsorships have the added benefit of enabling a company to associate its brand with
                the product it is sponsoring.
                Sponsorships come in all shapes and sizes.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Offline Marketing Can Complement Your Online Marketing Strategy. When deciding your marketing strategy,
              you should be sure to not ignore offline marketing. It has many benefits, especially to businesses that
              have a strong physical presence.
              Ultimately, the best solution for many businesses will be to include a range of marketing strategies to
              hit specific marketing goals.
            </p>
            <p>Conclusion:</p>
            <p>The ultimate goal of a marketing strategy is to achieve and communicate a sustainable competitive
              advantage over rival companies by understanding the needs and wants of its consumers.
            </p>
            <p>Any marketing initiatives should support your overall business plan.
              Before diving into executing any of these offline marketing methods, make sure they support your overall
              business plan and that your establishing goals and metrics to determine your return on investment.
            </p>
            <p>Effective marketing requires keeping up with the trends and constantly evolving to suit your audience’s
              changing needs. Along with that, it’s vital to use the latest tools that will allow you to better connect
              with your audience</p>
            <p>No matter if you utilize a traditional business plan or a planning tool, it’s important to utilize it
              when developing new marketing initiatives. Doing so can help you avoid costly mistakes and ensures any
              changes make sense for your business overall.
            </p>
            <p>While there are many aspects to offline marketing, they all have similar themes revolving around
              outreach, involvement, and being a confident advocate for yourself. Putting effort into both social and
              search marketing as well as these important offline marketing tactics will give your business the push it
              needs to rise to the top.
            </p>
            <p>Although online marketing is a phenomenal tool we urge you to think about taking some marketing efforts
              offline. It can often be inexpensive to experiment and although tracking can be hard, success can be huge.
